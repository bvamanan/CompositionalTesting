## Injecting Formal Methods into Internet Standardization

The goal of the project is to develop a methodology, supported by tools, that uses formal methods to gain clarity into the standards of network protocols and test the conformance of implementations to these standards. The work will be demonstrated on *QUIC*, a new complex protocol that is currently carrying about 10% of the internet traffic and is likely to carry much more of it in the near future. The standardization of QUIC is ongoing under the IETF. The software and the experimental results developed under this project will be stored in GitHub. The methodology itself will be widely disseminated by the usual means (publications, talks, etc.). The experimental results will be shared with the developers of QUIC implementations and the IETF.
